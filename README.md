# Movie-Recommendation
A movie recommendation model using jupyter on Google Colab. 
This project implements a movie recommendation system using Python and the TfidfVectorizer() method combined with cosine similarity to suggest movies based on user input. It processes a dataset of movies, extracting relevant features to generate personalized movie suggestions.

**Features:**

_Data Collection_: Load movie data from a CSV file.

_Feature Extraction_: Combine multiple features such as genres, keywords, tagline, cast, director, and user ratings.

_Text Vectorization:_ Convert text data into numerical feature vectors using TfidVectorizer().

_User Interaction_
: Prompt users for their favorite movie and return a list of recommended movies based on similarity.
